# Hey there! 👋

I'm Nimród, a versatile software developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies like Angular and React. With three years of experience in Angular development, I've mastered crafting intuitive user interfaces and seamless user experiences. Additionally, I've worked on multiple React projects, further broadening my expertise in front-end development.

Recently, I've delved into the realm of full-stack development, combining my frontend expertise with backend technologies like Java. I'm no stranger to Node.js either, having worked extensively with it in previous projects. My versatility across the stack allows me to architect end-to-end solutions that seamlessly integrate frontend and backend components.

## 📚 Background
My journey into the world of programming began during high school, where I first acquainted myself with C#. While I haven't had the opportunity to apply my C# knowledge in a professional setting yet, my solid foundation in the language, bolstered by high school finals and personal projects, remains a testament to my dedication and adaptability.

I'm a firm believer in practical, hands-on learning and often find myself dissatisfied with the traditional academic approach. Nevertheless, my experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a passion for continuous learning.
